# Slow YouTube

A slower YouTube, with no recommendations, just the channels you subscribe to, and only their most recent videos. After you watch a video, there's no reason to see it again.

## Development

Clone, `npm install`, yadda yadda. Run `npm run dev` to star the gulp job. Run `serve .` (or any static file serving program) to see your changes. When you're finished, look at the [distibution instructions](/docs/running.md) to see how to run it locally.
